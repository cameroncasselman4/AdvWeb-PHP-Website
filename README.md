# AdvWeb-PHP-Website

## About
students will create a one page site that collects data and includes drop down menus or search box(es) that can be used to retrieve this data.  The site should have a “story”: in other words, incorporate a fictional business, service, museum, or fandom activity (consider: http://www.whofic.com/categories.php?catid=1&mode=stories).  Specifically, the site can offer a parallel rationale for the database lookup–for example, offering a searchable lookup of images (by storing filenames) or other archived information (image, video, etc.).
